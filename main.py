        The Foreign Ownership, Control, and Influence (FOCI) threat to our current and future Critical
        and Emerging Technologies continues to grow and become more invasive. The is further
        compounded by the direct foreign investment, both private sector and Foreign Government
        Control, in U.S. companies as highlighted by the Committee for the Foreign Investment in the
        U.S. (CFIUS) process.\n
        This project would focus on an identified technology area/sector, and the U.S. companies
        working on or directly supporting the identified technology. The scoped example would be to
        define companies working on our Critical and Emerging Technologies (C&ET) down to the CAGE
        code as they relate to the identified technology, and as determined based on a defined
        proximity to a DoD facility/installation.
